# Gigaset CL660HX

The CL660HX is an universal handset for addition to DECT/GAP routers or base
stations.

## Teardown

The handset is not designed for easy opening. There are a lot of very tight clips in
the case that hold the top shell in place.

I used the iFixit _Jimmy_ tool to open the case next to the display a small
gap. After that, I used several plectrums to open the case completely.

:warning: Warning: If you open the case, the small speaker will fall out and
could be lost. Likewise, when you reassemble it, you have to put it back in
the right way around.
